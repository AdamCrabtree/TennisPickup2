## Synopsis

This is a giant project that's shows how bad programming can really look and still work. I'm currently in the process of rewriting this whole thing because it's just bad.
In essence this allows users on their phone to sign up, log in, and find matches with other users to play a pickup sports game with. It uses PHP to communicate
with a mySQL database and volley. It uses google firebase to allow users to chat with each other so they can figure out where the other person it. It uses google maps API to
find courts to play at. 

## Code Example

Absolutely none. God help you if you try to understand how this project works in terms of code until I remake the thing. I can only wish you the best of luck my friend.

## Motivation

To recreate the idea of League of Legends skill based matchmaking for real sports, specifically tennis. 

## Installation

You'll need an android phone to test it along with android studio but other than that you should be fine.

## License
