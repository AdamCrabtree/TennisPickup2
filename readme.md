## Synopsis

This is a project for android that allows users to sign up for tennis matches and play against other players! For those who are introverted this would be very useful for finding matches and is used extensively at my University! 
## Usage

Just launch the app on your phone after downloading and sign up! After sign up you'll see matches in your area with the ability to register and start chatting with the person who made those matches. After the match make sure you record who won and who lost so your match making rating is adjusted accordingly. We have a dispute system in place! 

## Motivation

To recreate the idea of League of Legends skill based matchmaking for real sports, specifically tennis. 

## Installation

You'll need an android phone to test it along with android studio but other than that you should be fine.
